Stable Release, TBC of May 2018

illumos-omnios branch r151026 at XXX

`uname -a` shows `omnios-r151026-XXX`

r151026 release repository: https://pkg.omniosce.org/r151026/core

## New features since r151024

### System Features

* `libdiskmgt` and therefore `diskinfo` now recognises nvme, sata and xen
  controllers

* The `/etc/screenrc` file delivered by the `screen` package is now based on
  the recommended global template as delivered by the authors; you may wish
  to check that it still meets your needs. If you have previously customised
  this file then it will not be updated but the new template file will be
  installed as `/etc/screenrc.new`.

### LX zones

* Report that `/proc/sys` is writable to keep systemd happy.

* Emulate a userspace clock of 100Hz to accommodate some broken applications.

### Hardware Support

### Commands and Command Options

* `/usr/gnu/bin/uname -o` reports `illumos` as the operating system.

### Developer Features

* GCC version 7 is now available - `pkg install developer/gcc7` - and can be
  found in `/opt/gcc-7`.

  Note that GCC 7's default standard for C++ is `-std=gnu++14`. This is a
  change from GCC 5 which used `-std=gnu++98`. Some software may assume
  gnu++98 and to compile it with GCC 7 you will need to specify
  `--std=gnu++98` or update the software. More detail on the changes in GCC 7
  can be found on
  [the gcc web site](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/changes.html).

* Perl has been upgraded to 5.26.X. The version of perl shipped with OmniOS
  is for internal system use and should not be relied on for anything else.

### Deprecated features

* GCC version 6 will be removed in the next stable version of OmniOS, r151028.
