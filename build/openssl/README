The openssl package contains both OpenSSL 1.0.x and 1.1.x versions.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 will not reach end-of-life until the end of 2019 but the
journey starts now.

The libraries for both are always present in /lib and /usr/lib so software
linked against a specific version will work but the other components such as
binaries, header file and man pages are switched in and out using an IPS
mediator. The default version is 1.0 and version 1.1 must be manually selected
if required. Having version 1.1 available now allows us to test and fix
problems over the next two years before 1.0.2 reaches end-of-support.

* It is possible to switch to v1.1 and build some software which will
  benefit from it (a good example being nginx) and then switch back to v1.0
  afterwards.
* OmniOS itself will continue to be built with v1.0.2 in
  the medium term and a check has been added to the build process for
  this.
* There are currently a handful of OmniOS userland packages which
  do not build with openssl 1.1, and illumos-omnios itself does not
  build with openssl 1.1. The list of those packages is being maintained
  in this file and will be updated as upstream packages are
  migrated to v1.
* Our OpenSSL v1.1 does not currently include the
  pkcs11 engine from Oracle (whereas v1.0 does). If this engine is
  required going forwards (and there seems to be some doubt that anyone
  cares) then it will need to be integrated later.
* I've also gone through the packages which had a hard-coded runtime
  dependency on openssl@1.0.2 and removed that if the dependency is
  automatically determined. For the packages where I did this, I also
  removed other redundant dependencies.
* The man page sections patch has gone and is now handled through the .mog
  file. Man pages are still installed in SSL sections.
