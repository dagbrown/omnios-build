  Here are guidelines for removing Vim by hand:
  
! 1. Remove the "Edit with Vim" popup menu entry, if it exists.  This will only
!    be on MS-Windows 95/98/NT.  This is done by running the uninstal.exe
!    program.  It removes the registry entries for the "Edit with Vim" popup
!    menu entry.  You only need to run uninstal.exe when you have installed the
!    menu entry.  You can also run uninstal.exe from the Control panel with the
!    Add/Remove programs application.
     Note that uninstal.exe offers you the option to uninstal other items.  You
     can skip this.

  5. Delete the distributed files.  If you followed the directions, these will
!    be located in a directory like "C:\vim\vim80".  If the $VIM environment
!    variable is set, the directory will be $VIM\vim80.  Delete the "vim80"
     directory and all that is in it.  Warning: If you changed any of the
     distributed files, or added some of your own files, you might want to save
     these first.  But normally you would not have changed or added files here.
