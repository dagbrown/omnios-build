! A pull request has the advantage that it will trigger the Continuous
! Integration tests, you will be warned of problems (you can ignore the coverage
! warning, it's noisy).
! 
! Please consider adding a test.  All new functionality should be tested and bug
! fixes should be tested for regressions: the test should fail before the fix and
! pass after the fix.  Look through recent patches for examples and find help
! with ":help testing".  The tests are located under "src/testdir".
! 
! Contributions will be distributed with Vim under the Vim license.  Providing a
! change to be included implies that you agree with this and your contribution
! does not cause us trouble with trademarks or patents.  There is no CLA to sign.
